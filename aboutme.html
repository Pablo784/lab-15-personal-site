      <p>From 2008 to 2009, I attended PS 55 in the Bronx. I completed my 3rd grade in this school after moving from Ecuador. </p>

      <p>Then, I transferred to PS 42, which is a few blocks away from PS 55. I completed my elementary school here and graduated in 2013.</p>

<p>In 2013, I got accepted into Bronx Alliance Middle School (BAMS). This school was the closest to my home. I finished middle school in 2016.</p>

<p>In 2016, I got accepted into World View High School (WVHS). This school shared floor space with Dewitt Clinton High School. I graduated in 2020, but unfortunately I was not able to have a graduation due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>The flag of the Country I am from; Ecuador</p>
<br>
<p>Some of my professional goals are to graduate college and get my masters degree in my major which is Emerging Media Technologies.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> Also, along with getting my degree is to graduate because that is the goal that is just as significant as getting my degree.</p>
